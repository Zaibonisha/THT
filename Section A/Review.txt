The code you've posted contains several issues that need to be addressed:

1. Type Annotation for Shift Parameter: The shift parameter should be of type number, not string. You can update its type annotation to number.

2.Function Signature: The function definition should include the types for the string and shift parameters.

3.Print Function: There's no built-in print function in JavaScript/TypeScript. You should use console.log() to print the output.
